# Dataset-Explorer

## Project description
This is a simple python-based GUI application to clean data and briefly analyze distribution of variables in a dataset. The application makes use of different methods for plotting histograms and cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of each column in the dataframe, and for calculating the correlation matrix based on different methodologies such as Pearson, Kendall, and Spearman. The script also provides a way to filter the correlation coefficients based on a user-defined threshold, and generates plots and outputs that can be saved in designated folders. 

## How to use
Run the main python file (DataExplorer.py) and use the GUI to navigate the various options and process the dataset. You can select the input folder where your data is located, as well as the output folder where to store your processed data and figures. 

### Requirements
Requirement.txt file is provided to ensure full compatibility with the python application. The application has been tested using Python 3.10.12 

### Program structure 
Coming soon
